To implement the Blood Bank Database Management System Website, I used SQL extensively to manage and organize the underlying database. SQL was applied to create and maintain tables for storing donor information, blood inventory, and hospital requests. I wrote queries to efficiently handle operations like inserting new donor records, updating inventory levels after donations, and retrieving available blood types based on recipient needs. SQL also enabled secure and accurate data retrieval, allowing users to search for specific blood types and track donation histories. At the end I have also executed various queries on database.
